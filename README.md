Laser Interface Networking Doohickey for AMSAT -- CircuitPython Implementation

## Overview

The Laser Interface Networking Doohickey for AMSAT (LINDA) is a subsystem which implements proof-of-concept laser communications for the [AMSAT CubeSatSim](https://github.com/alanbjohnston/CubeSatSim). It is designed around a Sparkfun Thing Plus RP2040 microcontroller, and uses a generic 650nm laser pointer and laser sensor to implement a basic free-space optical communication link between two LINDA subsystems.

This is where I would put a block diagram/wiring diagram IF I HAD ONE!
